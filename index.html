    <p><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="Wesley Schuh circa 2023">Hello there! My name is Wesley Schuh, and I am
      currently a sophomore computer science major with a focus in data analytics at Rose-Hulman Institute of
      Technology. I also plan to double major in mathematics if my schedule allows. As a result of both my coursework
      and independent study from my time at Rose, I have gained skills in various programming languages including
      Python, Java, C, and SQL; some assembly languages including ARM and RISC-V; and some core web development
      languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (which I used to build this page!).</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, some of my hobbies include building Legos, making games my friends and I can play together,
      and working on personal data analysis projects. I recently recieved a <a
        href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/TYQCPS38BXFM"
        target="_blank">data analytics certificate</a>
      from Google, in which I learned the importance of data-driven decison making and how to effectively use Excel,
      Google Sheets, Tableau, and more for analysis. I am currently working on the cybersecurity and UX design
      certificates from the same program. When I'm not working on those, you can typically find me online on Pokémon
      Showdown or Roblox. Feel free to contact me via my email listed in the footer of each page. I hope you enjoy my
      website!</p>
