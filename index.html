    <p><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="Wesley Schuh circa 2023">Hello there! My name is Wesley Schuh, and I am
      currently a sophomore computer science major with a focus in data analytics at Rose-Hulman Institute of
      Technology. I also plan to double major in mathematics if my schedule allows. As a result of both my coursework
      and independent study from my time at Rose, I have gained skills in various programming languages including
      Python, Java, C, and SQL; some assembly languages including ARM and RISC-V; and some core web development
      languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (which I used to build this page!).</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, some of my hobbies include building Legos, making games my friends and I can play together,
      and working on personal data analysis projects. I recently recieved a <a
        href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/TYQCPS38BXFM"
        target="_blank">data analytics certificate</a>
      from Google, in which I learned the importance of data-driven decison making and how to effectively use Excel,
      Google Sheets, Tableau, and more for analysis. I am currently working on the cybersecurity and UX design
      certificates from the same program. When I'm not working on those, you can typically find me online on Pok√©mon
      Showdown or Roblox. Feel free to contact me via my email listed in the footer of each page. I hope you enjoy my
      website!</p>
